# Go Hornet Storage Lib

This library will contain all functions required to easily connect and communicate with our Hornet Storage node in go. We have made the functions as simple as possible while still exposing lower level functionality for more advanced use cases and customisation. We will extend the features of this library over time to make it as easy as possible for users.

The library includes a very basic connection manager to help users handle being connected and communicating with multiple Hornet Storage nodes at once.
